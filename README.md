# Travel Distance Recommendation Engine

The used car market in the US for 2019 is estimated at $117.9 bn by revenue, and the market size for this sector has grown faster than the overall retail sector. The idea is to build an AI based web app that uses Google's location and search history to determine future travel patterns and recommends the most advantageous solution.
The algorithm aims to present a dashboard view of:

• The distance users are expected to drive in the next 6 months 
• Cost comparison between car and insurance, ride-hailing service, and car-pooling
• Recommendations from car dealerships nearby
